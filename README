You need python-lastfm [1] and python-decorator [2]. The second package is in
Debian, the first one isn't. For this reason the module is included as
subdirectory here.  Unfortunately python-lastfm doesn't work with python2.5, so
python2.6 is required.

To use the script in cmus, just set status_display_program to the path of the
cmus_lastfm_autoadd.py file. If you want to use multiple status display
programs, you have to write a wrapper shell script for both.
